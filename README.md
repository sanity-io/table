# Sanity Table Plugin

> This is a **Sanity Studio v3** plugin.
> For the v2 version, please refer to the [v2 repository](https://github.com/rdunk/sanity-plugin-table).

This is a (triple) fork of the Sanity Plugin Table, migrated to [Sanity Studio V3](https://beta.sanity.io/docs/platform/studio/v2-to-v3).
Only the v3 version is maintained by Sanity.io.

## Disclaimer

Sometimes a table is just what you need.
However, before using the Table plugin, consider if there are other ways to model your data that are:

- easier to edit and validate
- easier to query

Approaching your schemas in a more structured manner can often pay dividends down the line.

## Install

Install using npm

```bash
$ npm i --save @sanity/table
```

## Usage

Add the plugin to your project configuration. Then use the type in your schemas

```js
// sanity.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from 'sanity';

import { table } from '@sanity/table';

export default defineConfig({
  name: 'default',
  title: 'My Cool Project',
  projectId: 'my-project-id',
  dataset: 'production',
  plugins: [
    // Include the table plugin
    table(),
  ],
  schema: {
    types: [
      {
        name: 'product',
        title: 'Product',
        type: 'document',
        fields: [
          {
            // Include the table as a field
            // Giving it a semantic title
            name: 'sizeChart',
            title: 'Size Chart',
            type: 'table',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Configuration

You can optionally configure the `_type` used for the row object in the table schema by passing a `rowType` when adding the plugin. For most users this is unnecessary, but it can be useful if you are migrating from a legacy table plugin.

```js
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  plugins: [
    table({
      rowType: 'my-custom-row-type',
    }),
  ],
  // ...
});
```

### Release new version

Run ["CI & Release" workflow](https://github.com/sanity-io/table/actions/workflows/main.yml).
